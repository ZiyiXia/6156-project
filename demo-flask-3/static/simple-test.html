<h4>Web Application Servers</h4>

<p>
    <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask</a> is a simple
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_server">web application server.</a> There are many web
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_application_servers">web application servers.</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Java: Tomcat, Jetty, <a href="https://www.crn.com/news/storage/196901383/father-of-websphere-defects-from-ibm-to-microsoft.htm">
            WebSphere</a>, WebLogic, ...
        </li>
        <li>Python: Django, Flask.</li>
        <li>NodeJS</li>
        <li>Microsoft IIS</li>
        <li>... ...</li>
        </ul>

<p>
    There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">many web servers.</a>
</p>
<p>
    Most web application servers can also function as web servers. Instead of using S3, I could have served the
    HTML, CSS, ... ... directly from the flask application on EC2. Why did I pick the more complex configuration
    if I could have served the content from Flask? Well, I can pound a nail in with hammer or a banana. Both will
    work.
</p>
<p>
    Web serving and
    web application serving have different requirements. An engine that is good at web serving is not good at
    web application serving and vice-versa.

    When designing a SW system, "You cannot be a floor wax and a mouth wash. You have to pick." One of the strengths
    of the microservices is that you can optimize SW for a specific task instead of having one large program
    that tries to "be a floor wax and a mouth wash."

    We will cover microservice concepts later in this lecture and other lectures.
